## Abstract:
With the increasing wealth of Generation Z and the rapid diversification of entertainment, the blind box industry has made a big splash in the financial market. A blind box is a package with mystery contents that customers purchase from a particular brand. Under the leadership of some blind box companies and social media accounts, blind boxes have achieved huge market success in China in recent years. When toys become the hobby of ‘adults’, they bring cultural and business opportunities and challenges that should not be underestimated. Blind boxes, it may be inferred, have met customers' psychology of curiosity, pursuit of beauty, nostalgic mood, and need for companionship.

What is blind box, and why did it go viral? presents the history of how the blind box market developed since it was introduced to China and explores the psychological reasons why people are so addicted to it. This data visualization project focuses on how the blind box market became popular, the huge potential behind it, and why people are so addicted to blind boxes, as well as the psychological research behind it. Viewers of this project can get to know the famous IPs, the comparison with art toys, and filter out the economic growth and potential financial market year by year with both text narration and visual presentations.
